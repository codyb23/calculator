## Notes

- Take this in small steps just like we did in class. Start with the HTML, then CSS, then with basic functionality.

### Explorer Mode

- [x] Implement something similar to the example UI using HTML and CSS inside a React app
- [x] As a user, I should be able to add two numbers
- [x] As a user, I should be able to add subtract numbers
- [x] As a user, I should be able to add multiple numbers
- [x] As a user, I should be able to add divide numbers
- [x] The clear button should reset the current calculation

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Show the user their history in a list
- [ ] Be able to chain together results. For example, the user should be able to input `2 + 3 - 4 + 5` and get the correct answer
- [ ] Let the user use their keyboard in addition to the mouse

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Using your systems calculator app as inspiration, implement as many features as you can, including, but not limited to scientific mode, exponents, and the order of operations.
